The project presents a comprehensive analysis of LSTM, CNN, N-BEATS, and ensemble models concerning Bitcoin price prediction. It underscores the inefficacy of relying solely on closing prices for predicting future Bitcoin prices, particularly during periods of notable fluctuations in Bitcoin's closing values. Conversely, the inclusion of Bitcoin halving events alongside closing prices markedly enhances predictive accuracy. This suggests that integrating multiple variables into the prediction model significantly improves comprehension of market dynamics. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating diverse factors beyond just closing prices to develop more robust and effective prediction frameworks for Bitcoin prices
